# NHS-Open-Data-Dashboard---R-Shiny

Welcome to the NHS Open Data Dashboard. 

We plan to create a R Shiny Dashboard, and also use Tableau for planning purposes (these will also be added to Tableau public).

We aim to have the initial alpha stage of the app completed and up on a server by 1st of October 2024. This ideally will be the front page, with some reference file information, and one example tab (the considered one is waiting times due to it's importance).
